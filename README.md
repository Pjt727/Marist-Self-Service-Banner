# Marist-Self-Service-Banner
Web scraper for courses on Marist self-service

## Notes
- Data is admittedly over fit to my needs from another project
- Gets information on all courses and sections for a given term
    - Sections
        - section,instructor,meeting_times,campus,seat_cap,data_id, course_id
    - Courses
        - course_title,taught_how,subject,number,co_requisites,prerequisites,college,department,credit_hours,id
- Built to be fairly resilient to errors which sometimes some courses to not be loaded
